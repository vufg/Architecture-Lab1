Q:
LO 
HI
PC
$sp

git version control log

attack instructions notes:

Address overflow or misaligned access in I or D memory is not allowed

error message: illegal instruction found at 0xaddress

Note that NOP instruction
(sll $0, $0, 0=0x00000000) is the only exception for which no error is reported.

andi: immediate is unsigned
slti: immediate is signed
beq bne bgrz: immediate is signed

write $0 is prior to other error;

int tmp = 3587;
cout << bitset<32>(tmp) << endl;
cout << bitset<32>( (tmp) << 20) << endl;
cout << bitset<32>( (tmp) << 20 >> 20) << endl;

!!!!!!after error like misaligned data, reg will still be changed or not? do i have to output the data inside regs? NO

in sw function  if the instruction trys to write $s0, dmemory_access will still be excuted, right?

If the content of any register does not change from the previous cycle, then do not
output the register. For cases that all registers change no values, then output only the cycle index
and PC count.

load iimage address overflow

immediate sometimes is signed and sometimes is unsigned

addiu $t = $s + C  $s signed or unsigned?

mult $s0, $s1
mfhi $zero
multu $s0, $s1

上课问：
addi addiu
ori andi nori compare with 0xffff -->  0xffffffff or 0x0000ffff

rd x part, if other number appear, report error or not ?

1.在儲存instruction的時候，1k的imemory是把pc initial value當作第一個word還是把$0當作第一個word?
2.如果在儲存instruction的過程中超過了1k的imemory，應該把之前的overwrite?
3.1k的imemory, pc->0?
4.如果pc超過了沒有儲存instruction的dmemory的話應該怎麽辦呢？
